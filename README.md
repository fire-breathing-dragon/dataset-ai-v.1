AI Dataset Generator

**Overview**

This project is an AI-powered dataset generator that creates structured datasets based on user-defined categories, row counts, and column counts. The AI model uses LangChain and Deepseek to dynamically generate datasets in JSON format.

**Features**

Generate datasets in any category (e.g., math problems, science facts, random data).

Customizable structure: Define the number of rows and columns.

JSON output for easy integration into applications.

Uses LangChain PromptTemplate for structured dataset generation.

Handles large outputs with potential chunking or streaming solutions.
